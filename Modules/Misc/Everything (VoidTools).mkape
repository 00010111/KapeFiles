# For those who don't know, VoidTools Everything is what Windows search wishes it could be. Use it instead of Windows Search. Get it here: https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/
# Everything must have been exited completely in order for the Everything.db file to have been committed to disk. So for initial installs, it won't commit until the first exit.
# Should the download link above ever change, check on this page for a download link: https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/indexes/
# Module will output the converted database into a .efu file in the KAPE bin folder.
# .efu file can be read with a text editor or in the Everything tool itself. File -> Open File List in Everything and import the .efu file.
# Timestamps will be in 64-bit filetime when viewed in a text editor. Times can be converted here with the "FILETIME" option - https://www.silisoftware.com/tools/date.php
# Timestamps when imported into Everything will be converted.
# Special thanks to Eric Zimmerman for helping troubleshoot the creation of this Module!
