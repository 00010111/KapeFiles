# KapeFiles

## Please take a few minutes to Read The Friendly Manual included with KAPE for full and detailed information on all the properties in target and module files! This will save you time in the long run!!!

This repository serves as a place for community created Targets and Modules for use with KAPE.

Please send PRs should you come up with new targets or modules for inclusion in the project!

Please include binaries (if free to distribute) or at the very least, point the BinaryUrl property to the download location.

All other info including requirements, etc. should be documeted at the end of the module in comment blocks.

## NOTE: BEFORE INITIATING A PR, PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE DONE THE FOLLOWING:

## 1. Generated a unique GUID for the target or module
## 2. Verified KAPE parses the target or module cleanly via kape.exe --tlist or kape.exe --mlist. Check for any reported errors and correct as necessary

Thanks!!!
