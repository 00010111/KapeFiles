# QUICK START



For thorough documentation, view the Wiki from the links above. While a PDF manual is included with the KAPE download, the Wiki will be the most up to date documentation available.


## TL;DR; for target and module creation is stated below:

This repository serves as a place for community created Targets and Modules for use with KAPE.

Please send PRs should you come up with new targets or modules for inclusion in the project!

Please include binaries (if free to distribute) or at the very least, point the BinaryUrl property to the download location.

All other info including requirements, etc. should be documeted at the end of the module in comment blocks.

## NOTE: BEFORE INITIATING A PR, PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE DONE THE FOLLOWING:

## 1. Generated a unique GUID for the target or module
## 2. Verified KAPE parses the target or module cleanly via kape.exe --tlist or kape.exe --mlist. Check for any reported errors and correct as necessary

Thanks!!!
